# DEF - Decentralized Equity Funding

## About
The initial public offering (IPO) is a necessary but often difficult step for any company which aims to become successful. 
By putting up shares on the stock market, the company is able to secure funding for future development. 
However, the process of doing an IPO is long, expensive and difficult. The main reason for this is that an IPO is solely depending on investment banks which decide whether to take a company public or not. 
Such unfairness also exists for investors since only big companies and banks are allowed to participate in the primary market where newly issued stocks are offered. No individual can enter this market, especially no people from developing countries. 
This paper proposes a new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol called decentralized equity funding (DEF) to address these problems.

Broadly, DEF functions as follows: companies can create Equity Tokens (ETs), which are put up for sale on the DEF platform. 
Just like with stock shares, ETs give the holder the right to receive dividends and to make decisions in the company. 
The protocol funds itself by charging a fee on the mint of ETs.

## Advantegous...
### for companies to use DEF to go public
1. Cheaper and faster IPO without legal burdens
2. Independence from central investment bank, giving companies more control
3. More potential investors since DEF's decentral primary market is open for all - not only to big companies and banks

### for investors to buy EquityToken (ET) via DEF
1. Everyone (regardless of origin, economic status) can access DEF's decentral primary market of ETs
2. Access to broader range of companies (e. g. Start Ups)
3. ETs are more secure compared to current assets (stocks) due to decentralization
4. Potentally more involvement due to ETs' trustless verification of partially owning respective public company

## Limitations of DEF
1. DEF only provides the infrastructure for companies to go public and for investors to participate in the new decentral primary market. It is not responsible for the successfullness of the IPO and ROI for the investors. All risks need to be assessed by companies and investors on their own.
2. TBA
